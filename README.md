# ScrabbleGamePart1
I have created a scrabble game using Python 3. In this game you have to make a word from the given tiles and if your word is 
valid, then the game shows you the score of your word as well as the word with highest score and it's score that the user 
could have created from the given tile. If your word is not a valid word, then it will pop up a message accordingly in order
to notify the user.
